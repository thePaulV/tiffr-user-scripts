# tiffr-user-scripts
A collection of Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey user scripts to improve the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) film selection and scheduling process when using [tiffr](https://tiffr.com/).

# Features
These user scripts add a few convenience features to tiffr, including:

* Adding counts to shortlist and scheduled pages so you know how many films you're dealing with
* Adding keyboard shortcuts to the film pages
  * Left / right: go to previous / next film
  * Enter: favourite / unfavourite
  * Cmd/ctrl-enter: view trailer (if there is one)
  * Shift-enter: go to official tiff page for the film
  * g: google the film
* Adding a button to hide descriptions on the schedule page to get a more compact schedule (e.g. for printing)
* Numbering screenings of each film in the planner / schedule builder so you can identify premieres and earlier screenings

# Installation
These scripts require the Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey browser addons (tested on GreaseMonkey in Firefox). Once you've installed it, you can install the scripts here:
